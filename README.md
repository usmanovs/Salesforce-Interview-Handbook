## What is this?

Unlike typical software engineer job interviews, Salesforce interviews have no emphasis on algorithms and have more questions on Salesforce fundamental knowledge and expertise about the domain — i.e. Apex, Process Builders, Lightning Web Components. Some silly change.

While there are some existing resources to help Salesforce admins and developers in preparing for interviews, they are dispersed and incomplete.
