## These are the typical questions HR asks

1. Why are you looking for a new job?
1. What salary are you looking for?
1. Do you require visa sponsorship?
1. What did you do at your previous job?

Soft skills - When you're asked "How are you doing" at the start of an interview, make a power move.

This is prime time real estate to set the course of the conversation, don't just say "I'm good, how about you?".

This is your opportunity to connect with the interviewer before he begins evaluating you.

The prime and recency effects are very real, the interviewer will remember the beginning and the end of the interview the most. Notes will probably be rushed and focused, so you can set the tone by what you say first and last.

About how you're doing, you can start with a soft joke. If it's morning, you can joke about how the coffee is just kicking in. Find a joke that is natural to you.

When I was interviewing for roles in the US from Canada, I'd joke about cold Canadian weather.

In my experience, 95% of people respond really well to humour. The other 5% you probably don't want to work for anyway.
